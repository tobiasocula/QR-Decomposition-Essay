This repository contains a mini-research project and implementation I made for my college.  
The project is about comparing, coding and discussing several implementations for the QR-decomposition of matrices, written in Dutch.  
It contains explanations about the workings, numerical stability and number of FLOPS analysis for each method.  
I'm also comparing them by letting them solve two distinct problems; decomposing a famously instable matrix, and using QR-decomposition to help solve a large system of equations.
